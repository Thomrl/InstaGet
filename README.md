# InstaGet
Easily save instagram video/pictures, youtube thumbnails and twitch clips.

Just copy a link from instagram like: "https://www.instagram.com/p/BWlUWkZD0pr/?taken-by=gaming1empire" run the script, and it will get downloaded.

Make sure to change the directory if needed, and make sure you have a folder named "notInstagram" inside, if you also use it for youtube thumbnails and/or twitch clips.

If you add a link for a gallery it will download all pictures from that gallery.

# How to use
Download the script and bat file and throw them into your script folder.

Make sure you edit the directories in the code (line 34 and 37) and create the folders where you want the script to download to.

Make sure you have installed python 3.5 (<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-353/">Download Here</a>).

Then I recommend setting up <a href="https://youtu.be/5CGe3iuDfn0">this</a> to the folder you keep your scripts, to easily run them.

Make sure you have the modules: bs4, requests, pyperclip (If you dont know how to install modules it's shown here: http://i.imgur.com/Meww3nZ.png)

Then simply use windows run (windows button + R) and type in: instaget
