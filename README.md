# instagramSave
Easily save instagram video and pictures.

Can also save twitch clips and youtube thumbnails.

Just copy a link from instagram like: "https://www.instagram.com/p/BWlUWkZD0pr/?taken-by=gaming1empire" run the script, and it will get downloaded.

Make sure to change the directory if needed, and a folder named "notInstagram" inside, if you also use it for youtube thumbnails and/or twitch clips.

If you add a link for a gallery it will download all pictures from that gallery.
