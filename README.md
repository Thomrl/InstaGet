# InstaGet
Easily save instagram video/pictures, youtube thumbnails and twitch clips.

Just copy a link from instagram like: "https://www.instagram.com/p/BWlUWkZD0pr/?taken-by=gaming1empire" run the script, and it will get downloaded.

If you add a link for a gallery it will download all pictures from that gallery.

# How to use
Download the script and bat file and throw them into your scripts folder.

Run the bat file. (If you have setup the everyting as I've writen in Setup you can also use windows run (windows button + R) and type in: instaget + have a link copied

Things you need: Python3.5. Python modules: bs4, requests, pyperclip, lxml. 

Make sure you edit the directories in the code (line 34 and 37) and create the folders where you want the script to download to.

# Setup
If you do not have python 3.5 (<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-353/">Download Here</a>). I suggest installing it at e.g C:\Python35 so it's faster to go to in the cmd when you want to install modules.

Then I recommend setting up <a href="https://youtu.be/5CGe3iuDfn0">this</a> to the folder you keep your scripts, to easily run them with windows RUN (windows key + R).

If you dont know how to install modules it's shown here: http://i.imgur.com/Meww3nZ.png)
